# Experiments

One entry per training run, RL or BC, written **in the same session as the run**.

Constitution Principle VI: an unlogged run did not happen. This is not bookkeeping for its own
sake. The defence is an individual interview, and "I tried a few things and this one worked" is
not an answer to "why this value". A run that changed nothing is still worth an entry, because
knowing that a change made no difference is a result.

## How to fill this in

- **Run ID** is the same string passed to the trainer, so the row and the output directory
  cannot drift apart. RL uses `ppo_car_vNN`; BC uses `bc_<policy>_vNN`.
- **Changed** is what differs from the previous run of the same kind, in one line. If it needs
  an "and", that is two experiments and they should have been two runs.
- **Outcome** is what the numbers said, not whether it felt better.
- **Kept** records whether the change survived into the next run. A rejected change with its
  reason is more useful later than a row that quietly disappears.

Details that do not fit a table live beside the run: `results/bc/run_<id>/` for BC,
`results/tensorboard/` for RL.

## BC runs (M4)

| Date | Run ID | Changed | Outcome | Kept |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## RL runs (M3)

| Date | Run ID | Changed | Outcome | Kept |
|---|---|---|---|---|
